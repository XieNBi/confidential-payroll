## üéØ Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

This method enables automatic deployments whenever you push to GitHub.

#### Step 1: Connect to Netlify

1. Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
2. Click **"Sign up"** or **"Log in"**
3. Choose **"Sign up with GitHub"** (easiest option)

#### Step 2: Create New Site

1. Click **"Add new site"** ‚Üí **"Import an existing project"**
2. Choose **"Deploy with GitHub"**
3. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account
4. Select repository: **`XieNBi/confidential-payroll`**

#### Step 3: Configure Build Settings

Netlify should auto-detect settings from `netlify.toml`, but verify:

```
Base directory: frontend
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: frontend/dist
```

#### Step 4: Deploy

1. Click **"Deploy site"**
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete
3. Your site will be live at: `https://random-name-123456.netlify.app`

#### Step 5: Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Domain management**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Follow instructions to set up your domain

---

### Method 2: Manual Deploy (Drag & Drop)

This method is faster but requires manual re-deployment for updates.

#### Step 1: Build Locally

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd E:\ZAMAcode\004\frontend

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build
```

This creates a `frontend/dist/` folder with optimized production files.

#### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

1. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Log in to your account
3. Drag and drop the entire **`frontend/dist`** folder onto the Netlify dashboard
4. Wait for deployment to complete
5. Your site is live!

---

### Method 3: Netlify CLI

For advanced users who prefer command line.

#### Step 1: Install Netlify CLI

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

#### Step 2: Login

```bash
netlify login
```

This opens your browser for authentication.

#### Step 3: Initialize and Deploy

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd E:\ZAMAcode\004

# Initialize Netlify (first time only)
netlify init

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files

### `netlify.toml` (Already Created)

Located in project root. Key settings:

```toml
[build]
  base = "frontend/"
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist/"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### Important Notes:

1. **SPA Redirect**: The `/*` ‚Üí `/index.html` redirect ensures React Router works correctly
2. **Base Directory**: Set to `frontend/` so Netlify knows where to find package.json
3. **Node Version**: Set to Node 18 for compatibility

---

## üîß Post-Deployment Configuration

### Update Contract Addresses (If Needed)

If you deploy new contracts, update `frontend/src/constants/contracts.ts`:

```typescript
export const PAYROLL_SIMPLE_ADDRESS = "0xYourNewAddress";
export const PAYROLL_FHE_ADDRESS = "0xYourNewAddress";
```

Then push to GitHub (auto-deploys) or rebuild manually.

### Environment Variables

Netlify doesn't need environment variables for this project (all configs are in the frontend code), but if you add any:

1. Go to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
2. Click **"Add a variable"**
3. Add your variables
4. Redeploy

---

## üåê Custom Domain Setup

### Option 1: Netlify Subdomain (Free)

1. Go to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Domain management** ‚Üí **Custom domains**
2. Click **"Options"** ‚Üí **"Edit site name"**
3. Change from `random-name-123456` to `confidential-payroll`
4. Your site: `https://confidential-payroll.netlify.app`

### Option 2: Your Own Domain

1. Purchase domain from provider (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. In Netlify: **Site settings** ‚Üí **Domain management** ‚Üí **Add custom domain**
3. Enter your domain: `yourdomain.com`
4. Follow Netlify's DNS configuration instructions

**Example DNS Records:**

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 75.2.60.5

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: your-site-name.netlify.app
```
